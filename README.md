# Why I Watched That Movie At That Time?


This repository includes the data of all the movies and tv shows 🎬 🎦 that I‘ve watched during the past year from August 2021 to July 2022. 

The tool I used to track the movies/tv shows activities is a Chinese social networking service named [Douban.com](https://movie.douban.com), which allows registered users to create and track content 📝 related to film, books, music and recent events. 

I scraped my own social media pages on Douban for movies' data collection and found a subtle pattern that might be able to explain how my movie activities were affected when I first moved to a new country⛱️.

About data folder:

- You can find raw data I pulled from the webpages along with a clean version I edited after so here. 
- I am also including the major data analysis notebooks here in case you might want to check how I scrape, clean and prepare for the further data analysis.

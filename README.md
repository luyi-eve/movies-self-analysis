# Why I Watched That Movie At That Time?


This repository includes the data of all the movies and tv shows that Iâ€˜ve watched during the past year from August 2021 to July 2022. 

The tool I used to track the movies/tv shows activities is a Chinese social networking service named [Douban.com](https://movie.douban.com), which allows registered users to create and track content related to film, books, music and recent events. 

I scraped my own social media pages on Douban for movies' data collection and found a subtle pattern that might be able to explain how my movie activities were affected when I first moved to a new country.

data folder includes four parts as below:

- 01_Scrape and clean movies data.ipynb

- 02_Prepare for further data analysis.ipynb

- raw_douban_movies.csv

- clean_douban_movies_edited.xls

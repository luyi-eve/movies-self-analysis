# Why I Watched That Movie At That Time?


This repository includes the data of all the movies and tv shows that Iâ€˜ve watched during the past year from August 2021 to July 2022. 

The tool I used to track the movies/tv shows activities is [Douban.com](https://movie.douban.com), a Chinese social networking service which allows registered users to create and track content related to film, books, music and recent events. 

I then scraped my own social media pages on Douban for movies' data collection and found a subtle pattern that might be able to explain how my movie activities were affected when I first moved to a new country.
